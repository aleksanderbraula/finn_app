# finn_app
1. Description:

  This is fairly simple app that loads from api and shows them. 
  I used some fairly standard libraries for common tasks:
- glide - image loading
- retrofit - api access
- dagger-hilt - dependancy injection
- room - database

I tried to make it up to date with industry standards. 

2. What I'm proud of:

I'm quite proud of the method of communication between views/fragments with mutable state flows. I'm also quite happy with the outcome given the time constraint. 

3. What I could have done better/ more:

Given more time I would definetly write more tests and maybe work on the UI a bit more
